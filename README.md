### 👨‍💻 **About Me**
I am a **Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)** graduate from **Arizona State University** with a unique dual background: **5+ years of commercial experience** managing $12M+ portfolios, combined with the technical firepower to build ML models and optimize operations.

I don't just analyze data; I translate it into **strategy**.
* 🎓 **Alumni:** W. P. Carey School of Business, ASU (MSBA).
* 💼 **Experience:** Ex-Engineer @ Taiyo Nippon Sanso (Managed $12M+ Accounts).
* 🔭 **Focus:** Supply Chain Network Design, Predictive Modeling, & Process Improvement (Six Sigma).
* ⚡ **Fun Fact:** I once used a Monte Carlo simulation to save a client $1.15M - without writing a single line of production code.
